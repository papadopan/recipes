# @TODO: Write at least two tests for each endpoint - one each for success and error behavior.
#        You can feel free to write additional tests for nuanced functionality,
#        Such as adding a book without a rating, etc. 
#        Since there are four routes currently, you should have at least eight tests. 
# Optional: Update the book information in setUp to make the test database your own! 


# Make the tests conveniently executable
